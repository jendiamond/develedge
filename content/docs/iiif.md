## [IIIF image presentation API specs](https://iiif.io/about/)

The International Image Interoperability Framework is an API that provides a standardised method of describing and delivering images over the web, as well as "presentation based metadata" of institutions holding artworks, books, newspapers, manuscripts, maps, scrolls, single sheet collections, and archival materials.

IIIF provids endpoints for their content, any IIIF-compliant viewer or application can consume and display both the images and their structural and presentation metadata.

### IIIF
+ Gives scholars an unprecedented level of uniform and rich access to image-based resources hosted around the world
+ Defines a set of common application programming interfaces that support interoperability between image repositories
+ Develops, cultivates and documents shared technologies, such as image servers and web clients, that provide a world-class user experience in viewing, comparing, manipulating and annotating images.
